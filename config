# example meat config file
#
# All options here can be overridden with flags on the command line. All options
# are case sensitive. This file will be read per user, and should be located at
# "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meat/config" or "$HOME/.config/meat/config"
#

# Default directory to download and build in. This is an absolute path, and 
# honors parameter and tilde expansions. If this directory does not exist, it 
# will be created, along with any necessary parent directories. This is
# identical to passing -t or --target on the command line.
#
#download_dir=/tmp/meat

# Use color in the output. This is a string used to determin use or color. 
# {always,auto,never}. 'always' is identical to passing -c, on the command line.
# pacman-color can also be installed to have colorized pacman output, and is
# also controlled through this option.
# If the command line option is supplied `--color={always,auto,never}` then
# the value here will not be used..
#
#color=auto

# Connection timeout to be passed to cower (in seconds). Setting this to 0 
# will disable timeouts. Default value is 10. Must be an integer.
#
#timeout=10

# Max number of threads that cower will use. This is synonymous with the max
# number of concurrent connections that will opened to the AUR. In practice,
# you should never need to bother with this setting. Other than a case of a
# -u or --update operation with no targets specified, a thread is created for
# each target provided. If cower has fewer targets than threads specified, the
# number of threads created will instead be the number of targets.
# This must be an integer, default value is 10.
#
#threads=10

# Tell cower to avoid using SSL connections. This is an integer used as a 
# boolean value, either '0' or '1'. '1' is identical to passing --nossl on the
# command line.
#
#nossl=1

# Prompt to check every regular file downloaded for a package. This is
# recommended for safety/security reasons, but is off by default because of the
# time consumption involved with checking each file. It is an integer used as a
# boolean value, either '0' or '1'. '1' is identical to passing --check-all on
# the command line.
#
#check_all=1

### The following four options will not be overridden by options on the command
### line. Instead, passing options on the command line will add to these lists.

# Ignore the specified packages when checking for updates. This is an array.
# This list is passed to both cower and pacman.
#
#ignore=()

# Ignore the specified binary repos when checking for updates. This is an array.
# This list is passed to cower.
#
#repo_ignore=()

# Ignore the specified groups for pacman commands. This is an array.
#
#group_ignore=()

# Ignore the specified git packages. This is used for the --git-check (-g) and
# --git-db-update options. Both of these options are highly experimental.
# This is an array.
#
#git_ignore=()

# vim: set noet syn=sh
